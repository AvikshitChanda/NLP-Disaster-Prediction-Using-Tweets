# NLP-Disaster-Prediction-Using-Tweets
## This repository explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict real-world disasters from Twitter data.

## Project Overview
## In times of crisis, social media platforms like Twitter become crucial for spreading information. This project aims to leverage the power of NLP to analyze tweets and identify those that signal real disasters. By effectively classifying disaster-related tweets, we can potentially:

## Improve emergency response times.
## Enhance situational awareness for disaster relief organizations.
Provide early warnings to affected communities.
Technologies Used
Python (programming language)
NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK)
Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
